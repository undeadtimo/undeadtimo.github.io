### 쇼핑몰 프로젝트에 간단하게 사용하기 위한 용도

추천 알고리즘에는 Content Based Filtering(콘텐츠 기반 필터링)과 Collaborative Filtering(협업 필터링)이 존재한다.

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
